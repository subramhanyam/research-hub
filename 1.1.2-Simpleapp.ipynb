Introduction\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare is emerging as one of the most\\ndynamic areas of research and development worldwide. The foundational\\nideas date to the 1950s, when the Turing test was proposed as an opera-\\ntional benchmark for machine intelligence. Subsequent methodological and\\nhardware advances over the years have enabled translational applications\\nacross health sciences [1]. Today, AI and machine learning (ML) power\\na broad spectrum of products and services: from business analytics and\\nrobotics to voice-interactive assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assis-\\ntant [2]. Healthcare, in particular, has seen rapid growth in AI investment\\nand adoption since 2016, reflecting the potential of technology in this indus-\\ntry to improve outcomes and reduce costs [1, 3, 4, 5, 6].\\nThere are many uses for ML/AI in medical applications for clinical cases\\nbeyond basic operations. For clinicians, high-quality treatment recommenda-\\ntions depend on deep domain expertise and experience in interpreting com-\\nplex heterogeneous information. As electronic health records (EHRs) have\\nbecome the primary medium of documentation, clinicians spend substan-\\ntial time on data entry, yet the resulting information, collected in part to\\nenable billing and administrative workflows and in part to support clinical\\ncare and longitudinal analysis, remains difficult to synthesize during brief pa-\\ntient encounters. In addition, EHR data span both structured elements (e.g.,\\n2'),\n",

Significance of CRS Surgical Outcome Prediction\\nAnalyses of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)\\nfrom the late 1980s and early 1990s reported rising office visits for sinusitis\\nand identified sinusitis as one of the leading indications for antibiotic pre-\\nscribing in U.S. outpatient practice [25]. More recently, a national claims\\nanalysis showed that rhinosinusitis accounts formore outpatient antibiotic\\nprescriptions than any other diagnosis, underscoring its outsized contribu-\\ntion to community antibiotic use [26]. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is also a\\nmajor economic burden: contemporary estimates place direct medical costs\\nin the United States at roughly $10–$13billion annually, with an additional\\n∼$20billion in indirect costs from productivity loss [12, 27].\\nGiven these statistics, it is paramount to achieve rapid and durable dis-\\nease control in this chronic disease by quickly traversing the clinical manage-\\nment algorithm. In CRS, patient-reported quality of life (QoL) is a primary\\noutcome and decision anchor, with instruments such as the SNOT-22 recom-\\nmended for tracking severity and response [16, 13, 28]. According to current\\nestimates, about 300,000 ESS operations for CRS have been carried out an-\\nnually in the U.S, with 30–40% of patients showing unsatisfactory results in\\nterms of achieving clinically significant SNOT-22 benefits [14, 15]. According\\nto another recent study, 20-30% of CRS patients who underwent endoscopic\\nsinus surgery (ESS) reported that their post-treatment symptom reduction\\nfell short of their expectations. Patient satisfaction with CRS intervention\\nwas strongly associated with the extent to which outcome expectations were\\nmet. [29].\\nMost patients with medically refractory CRS do improve with surgery,\\nbut a substantial minority, on the order of one in three, derive limited bene-\\nfit when SNOT-22 is the primary outcome of interest [14, 15]. This variability\\nat the individual level motivates our study: if clinicians and patients could\\naccesspre-operative, patient-specific estimates of surgical benefit, they could\\nbetter weigh procedural and anesthesia risks against likely QoL gains, engage\\nin more informed shared decision-making, and set realistic expectations [11].\\nSuch individualized risk-benefit estimation is a central promise of personal-\\nized medicine and a key motivation for the rapid growth of structured data\\ncollection in healthcare over the past decade.

Related & Prior Work\\n3.1. Clinical guidance for CRS decision-making\\nContemporary care pathways for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) emphasize\\naccurate phenotyping, optimization of medical therapy, and patient-centered\\nshared decision-making about elective endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) when\\nsymptoms remain refractory [13, 30]. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs)–\\nin particular the SNOT-22–are recommended to quantify baseline burden\\nand to track response to therapy [16, 13]. Several longitudinal studies have\\ndemonstrated efficacy of ESS in this situation, and identified risk factors\\nfor treatment success/failure. But, the medical and sociodemographic vari-\\nables are complex and interactive, and to date, no risk calculator exists in\\npractice. Meta-analyses consistently show large average post-ESS improve-\\nments in SNOT-22, yet with wide interpatient variability [14, 15]. Current\\nguidelines provide indication frameworks, but they stop short of offering in-\\ndividualized, pre-operative predictions of benefit using routinely available\\nclinical variables [30]. This creates a practical gap for clinicians and patients\\nseeking personalized risk–benefit estimates to guide shared decision-making.\\n3.2. Predictive models in rhinology and sinus surgery\\nPredictive modeling in rhinology remains comparatively sparse and het-\\nerogeneous.

Much of the existing literature centers on\\npopulation-level effect sizes, disease control categories, or biomarker/imaging\\ncorrelates rather than point-of-care prediction from routine pre-operative\\nclinical records [13]. Consequently, there is no widely adopted, validated\\npre-operative tool that estimates a CRS patient’s probability of achieving a\\nclinically meaningful SNOT-22 improvement after ESS using standard clini-\\ncal data elements.

Also transparency in the process from data gathering,\\nprocessing, assessment, experiments, reporting etc. is now expected, using\\nTRIPOD+AI guidelines as we do here [33] or similar alternative (CHAI [34]).\\nA paper in this arena should follow at least one of these and mention which\\none. Best practices emphasize calibration, transparency of feature influence,\\nand evaluation of net clinical utility versus treat-all or treat-none heuristics\\n[11]. However, translation to CRS has lagged: most published clinical ML\\nalgorithms either rely on imaging-heavy pipelines or small, single-center co-\\nhorts, and they frequently omit core translational checks such as probability\\ncalibration and decision-curve (net-benefit) analysis—steps that are essential\\nfor clinical deployment [31, 11, 35, 36, 37, 38].\\n3.4.

Dataset\\nFor predicting surgical outcomes (i.e., the potential effectiveness of ESS in\\nCRS patients considering surgery), training the model is a major initial task.\\nCurrently, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) is the most widely\\naccepted sinus QOL tool for analyzing CRS patient-reported outcomes. It is\\nan extensively validated set of 22 standard questions for understanding CRS\\nsymptom severity [14, 15, 28, 29]. Here, the patient rates each question on\\na Likert-type scale in the range of 0 to 5, resulting in a total score range\\nbetween 0 to 110. Higher scores depict the worst QoL [15].\\nTo understand outcomes from medical and surgical intervention in CRS,\\nan NIH-funded multicenter CRS outcomes study was designed and under-\\ntaken (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01332136). This study recorded detailed demo-\\ngraphic and clinical metadata in a longitudinal fashion, along with patient-\\nreported outcomes, including (1) a sinus-specific evaluation (SNOT-22), and\\n(2) a general health measure (SF6d-derived health utility value, HUV) [39].\\nA standardized collection of∼30 clinical and demographic common data ele-\\nments available to practicing physicians was performed throughout this study\\nand used as the set of predictor variables.\\nWe began with a development cohort of 791 patients (50 attributes; typ-\\nical missingness for some clinical fields, referred to as the 2R01 dataset for\\nthe rest of the paper) and a second, independent cohort of 355 patients\\nfrom a related multicenter CRS outcomes study with comparable clinician-\\nrecorded metadata (henceforth, referred to as the 3R01 dataset). In this\\npaper, we restrict analysis to patients who actually underwent sinus surgery,\\nbecause our objective is to build a model that flags cases that may be rec-\\nommended to avoid surgery (i.e., would not achieve sufficient postoperative\\nbenefit). Operationally, this means we considered only the “surgery” cases,\\nexcluded patients managed medically (no surgery). So, we concatenated the\\ntwo cohorts, and retained only those with sinus surgery as the treatment. Af-\\nter these filters, the combined dataset comprised 524 surgical patients. For\\nthis multicenter, observational CRS surgical outcomes study with six differ-\\nent tertiary rhinology practice sites, institutional review board approval was\\ngained for each site, and de-identified data were shared for this investigation\\n(COMIRB #19-2085).\\n9'),\n",

For binary clinical prediction tasks, accuracy alone\\ncan be misleading, particularly under class imbalance; complementary met-\\nrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUROC),\\nand confusion matrix are recommended [43, 37].\\n10'),\n",

Note, this\\nprocess was repeated for both the 2R01 and 3R01 datasets.\\nFor the 2R01 dataset, initially, there were a total of 791 rows of patient\\ndata with 50 attributes as columns. First, we chose the subset where treat-\\nment was sinus surgery, reducing the dataset to 604 rows. There were missing\\ndata and unwanted attributes present which might not be useful for accurate\\nsurgery outcome prediction. So, in the cleaning process, all the unwanted\\ncolumns were removed from this dataset under a physician’s guidance. Then,\\nall the blank spaces (i.e., the null values) in all the columns of the patient\\nwere removed.
