      "title": "Task segmentation based on transition state clustering for surgical robot assistance",
      "summary": "Understanding surgical tasks represents an important challenge for autonomy in surgical robotic systems. To achieve this, we propose an online task segmentation framework that uses hierarchical transition state clustering to activate predefined robot assistance. Our approach involves performing a first clustering on visual features and a subsequent clustering on robot kinematic features for each visual cluster. This enables to capture relevant task transition information on each modality independently. The approach is implemented for a pick-and-place task commonly found in surgical training. The validation of the transition segmentation showed high accuracy and fast computation time. We have integrated the transition recognition module with predefined robot-assisted tool positioning. The complete framework has shown benefits in reducing task completion time and cognitive workload.",

      "summary": "AI-driven semi-autonomous robotic surgery is essential for addressing the medical challenges of long-duration interplanetary missions, where limited crew sizes and communication delays restrict traditional surgical approaches. Current robotic surgery systems require full surgeon control, demanding extensive expertise and limiting feasibility in space. We propose a novel adaptation of the Fuzzy Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm for obstacle avoidance and collaborative control in a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm modeled on the Miniaturized Robotic-Assisted surgical system. It was found that the Fuzzy Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm resulted in an 743 percent improvement to path search time and 43 percent improvement to path cost.",

      "summary": "The endoscopic camera of a surgical robot provides surgeons with a magnified 3D view of the surgical field, but repositioning it increases mental workload and operation time. Poor camera placement contributes to safety-critical events when surgical tools move out of the view of the camera. This paper presents a proof of concept of an autonomous camera system for the Raven II surgical robot that aims to reduce surgeon workload and improve safety by providing an optimal view of the workspace showing all objects of interest. This system uses transfer learning to localize and classify objects of interest within the view of a stereoscopic camera. The positions and centroid of the objects are estimated and a set of control rules determines the movement of the camera towards a more desired view. Our perception module had an accuracy of 61.21% overall for identifying objects of interest and was able to localize both graspers and multiple blocks in the environment. Comparison of the commands proposed by our system with the desired commands from a survey of 13 participants indicates that the autonomous camera system proposes appropriate movements for the tilt and pan of the camera.",

      "title": "Spatial Monitoring and Insect Behavioural Analysis Using Computer Vision for Precision Pollination",
      "summary": "Insects are the most important global pollinator of crops and play a key role in maintaining the sustainability of natural ecosystems. Insect pollination monitoring and management are therefore essential for improving crop production and food security. Computer vision facilitated pollinator monitoring can intensify data collection over what is feasible using manual approaches. The new data it generates may provide a detailed understanding of insect distributions and facilitate fine-grained analysis sufficient to predict their pollination efficacy and underpin precision pollination. Current computer vision facilitated insect tracking in complex outdoor environments is restricted in spatial coverage and often constrained to a single insect species. This limits its relevance to agriculture. Therefore, in this article we introduce a novel system to facilitate markerless data capture for insect counting, insect motion tracking, behaviour analysis and pollination prediction across large agricultural areas. Our system is comprised of edge computing multi-point video recording, offline automated multispecies insect counting, tracking and behavioural analysis. We implement and test our system on a commercial berry farm to demonstrate its capabilities. Our system successfully tracked four insect varieties, at nine monitoring stations within polytunnels, obtaining an F-score above 0.8 for each variety. The system enabled calculation of key metrics to assess the relative pollination impact of each insect variety. With this technological advancement, detailed, ongoing data collection for precision pollination becomes achievable. This is important to inform growers and apiarists managing crop pollination, as it allows data-driven decisions to be made to improve food production and food security.",

      "summary": "We devise a universal adaptive neural layer to \"learn\" optimal frequency filter for each image together with the weights of the base neural network that performs some computer vision task. The proposed approach takes the source image in the spatial domain, automatically selects the best frequencies from the frequency domain, and transmits the inverse-transform image to the main neural network. Remarkably, such a simple add-on layer dramatically improves the performance of the main network regardless of its design. We observe that the light networks gain a noticeable boost in the performance metrics; whereas, the training of the heavy ones converges faster when our adaptive layer is allowed to \"learn\" alongside the main architecture. We validate the idea in four classical computer vision tasks: classification, segmentation, denoising, and erasing, considering popular natural and medical data benchmarks.",

      "summary": "The chapter discusses the foundational impact of modern generative AI models on information access (IA) systems. In contrast to traditional AI, the large-scale training and superior data modeling of generative AI models enable them to produce high-quality, human-like responses, which brings brand new opportunities for the development of IA paradigms. In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios. Additionally, it examines the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm and other methods for corpus modeling and understanding, demonstrating how generative AI can enhance information access systems. It also summarizes potential challenges and fruitful directions for future studies.",

Research addressed: How has OpenAI's public discourse leveraged 'ethics', 'safety', 'alignment' and adjacent related concepts over time, and what does discourse signal about framing in practice? A structured corpus, differentiating between communication for a general audience and communication with an academic audience, was assembled from public documentation. Analysis. Qualitative content analysis of ethical themes combined inductively derived and deductively applied codes. Quantitative analysis leveraged computational content analysis methods via NLP to model topics and quantify changes in rhetoric over time. Visualizations report aggregate results. For reproducible results, we have released our code at https://github.com/famous-blue-raincoat/AI_Ethics_Discourse. Results. Results indicate that safety and risk discourse dominate OpenAI's public communication and documentation, without applying academic and advocacy ethics frameworks or vocabularies. Conclusions. Implications for governance are presented, along with discussion of ethics-washing practices in industry.",

      "title": "Beyond Volume: The Impact of Complex Healthcare Data on the Machine Learning Pipeline",
      "summary": "From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques.",

      "summary": "Data science has become increasingly essential for the production of official statistics, as it enables the automated collection, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.\n  This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.",

Traditional bias estimation approaches based on the Kalman filter suffer from implementation complexity and require non-intuitive tuning procedures. In this paper we propose, as an alternative, a simple observer that estimates inertial sensor biases exclusively in terms of quantities with obvious geometrical meaning. By this, any multidimensional vector-matrix operations are avoided and observer tuning is substantially simplified. The observer has been successfully tested in a farming vehicle navigation system.",

Their resolution usually requires coordinated and concurrent action execution. In several cases, these problems are naturally decomposed in a hierarchical way and expressed by a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) formalism.\n  HDDL, a hierarchical extension of the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), unlike PDDL 2.1 does not allow to represent planning problems with numerical and temporal constraints, which are essential for real world applications. We propose to fill the gap between HDDL and these operational needs and to extend HDDL by taking inspiration from PDDL 2.1 in order to express numerical and temporal expressions.

      "summary": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the computational efficiency and service quality in intelligent transportation systems by enabling vehicles to wirelessly offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby Roadside Units. However, efficient task offloading and resource allocation for time-critical applications in VEC remain challenging due to constrained network bandwidth and computational resources, stringent task deadlines, and rapidly changing network conditions. To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility. To solve $\\mathbf{P}$, we propose $\\mathtt{SARound}$, an approximation algorithm based on Linear Program rounding and local-ratio techniques, that improves the best-known approximation ratio for DOAP from $\\frac{1}{6}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we design an online service subscription and offloading control framework to address the challenges of short task deadlines and rapidly changing wireless network conditions. To validate our approach, we develop a comprehensive VEC simulator, VecSim, using the open-source simulation libraries OMNeT++ and Simu5G. VecSim integrates our designed framework to manage the full life-cycle of real-time vehicular tasks. Experimental results, based on profiled object detection applications and real-world taxi trace data, show that $\\mathtt{SARound}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying network conditions while maintaining runtime efficiency.",

      "title": "Real-Time-Data Analytics in Raw Materials Handling",
      "summary": "This paper proposes a system for the ingestion and analysis of real-time sensor and actor data of bulk materials handling plants and machinery. It references issues that concern mining sensor data in cyber physical systems (CPS). The advance of cyber physical systems has created a significant change in the architecture of sensor and actor data. It affects the complexity of the observed systems in general, the number of signals being processed, the spatial distribution of the signal sources on a machine or plant and the global availability of the data. There are different definitions for what constitutes cyber physical systems: the most succinct and pertinent to the work shown in this paper is the definition given by the IEEE: A CPS is a system with a coupling of the cyber aspects of computing and communications with the physical aspects of dynamics and engineering that must abide by the laws of physics. This includes sensor networks, real-time and hybrid systems. Results computed from sensor and actor data must obey the equations used for modelling the physics of the observed system - this fundamentally poses an inverse problem. Such problems are not covered sufficiently by literature addressing mining of sensor data. Even available standard books on mining sensor data do not discuss the special nature of sensor data. Typically, present approaches of mining data rely on correlation as being a sole, reliable measure for significance. It is not taken into account that the inverse solutions to the model-describing equations are required to establish a semantic link between a sensor observation and its precedent cause. Without this link - without causality - there can be no physics based knowledge discovery.",

      "summary": "This study evaluates the application of predictive analytics for real-time cyber-attack detection and response, focusing on how statistical and machine learning methods can improve decision-making in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Using a curated network-traffic dataset of 2,000 records, we analyzed key features such as attack type, packet length, anomaly scores, protocol usage, and geo-location patterns to assess their predictive value. Findings indicate that attack type has a measurable influence on response actions, while basic header metrics alone lack the precision needed for accurate classification. These results highlight the importance of incorporating richer contextual features - such as user behavior, asset criticality, and temporal patterns - into predictive models. By integrating such features into operational pipelines, organizations can improve early threat detection, reduce false positives, and optimize resource allocation. This research contributes actionable insights for advancing proactive, data-driven cyber defense strategies and outlines directions for future implementation in live SOC environments.",

      "summary": "While we pay attention to the latest advances in clinical natural language processing (NLP), we can notice some resistance in the clinical and translational research community to adopt NLP models due to limited transparency, interpretability, and usability. In this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework. We evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The corpora were derived from texts from three different institutions (Mayo Clinic, University of Kentucky, University of Minnesota). The gold standard annotations were tested with a single institution's (Mayo) ruleset. This resulted in performances of 0.876, 0.706, and 0.694 in F-scores for Mayo, Minnesota, and Kentucky test datasets, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study and adoption. Although we use COVID-19 as a use case in this effort, our framework is general enough to be applied to other domains of interest in clinical NLP.",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Review of State-of-The-Art Methods for Java Code Generation from Natural Language Text",
      "summary": "Java Code Generation consists in generating automatically Java code from a Natural Language Text. This NLP task helps in increasing programmers' productivity by providing them with immediate solutions to the simplest and most repetitive tasks. Code generation is a challenging task because of the hard syntactic rules and the necessity of a deep understanding of the semantic aspect of the programming language. Many works tried to tackle this task using either RNN-based, or Transformer-based models. The latter achieved remarkable advancement in the domain and they can be divided into three groups: (1) encoder-only models, (2) decoder-only models, and (3) encoder-decoder models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the evolution and progress of deep learning models in Java code generation task. We focus on the most important methods and present their merits and limitations, as well as the objective functions used by the community. In addition, we provide a detailed description of datasets and evaluation metrics used in the literature. Finally, we discuss results of different models on CONCODE dataset, then propose some future directions.",
