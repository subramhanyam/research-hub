Through an enormous experimental \neffort1\u20134, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but \nthis represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural \ncoverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed \nto address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the \nthree-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid \nsequence\u2014the structure prediction component of the \u2018protein folding problem\u2019\n8\u2014has \nbeen an important open research problem for more than 50\u00a0years9. Despite recent \nprogress10\u201314, existing methods fall far\u00a0short of atomic accuracy, especially when no \nhomologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method \nthat can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which \nno similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural \nnetwork-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein \nStructure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with \nexperimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other \nmethods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning \napproach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, \nleveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.\nThe development of computational methods to predict \nthree-dimensional (3D) protein structures from the protein sequence \nhas proceeded along two complementary paths that focus on either the \nphysical interactions or the evolutionary history. The physical interac-\ntion programme heavily integrates our understanding of molecular \ndriving forces into either thermodynamic or kinetic simulation of pro -\ntein physics16 or statistical approximations thereof17. Although theoreti -\ncally very appealing, this approach has proved highly challenging for \neven moderate-sized proteins due to the computational intractability \nof molecular simulation, the context dependence of protein stability \nand the difficulty of producing sufficiently accurate models of protein \nphysics. The evolutionary programme has provided an alternative in \nrecent years, in which the constraints on protein structure are derived \nfrom bioinformatics analysis of the evolutionary history of proteins, \nhomology to solved structures18,19 and pairwise evolutionary correla-\ntions20\u201324. This bioinformatics approach has benefited greatly from the steady growth of experimental protein structures deposited in \nthe Protein Data Bank (PDB)5, the explosion of genomic sequencing \nand the rapid development of deep learning techniques to interpret \nthese correlations. Despite these advances, contemporary physical \nand evolutionary-history-based approaches produce predictions that \nare far\u00a0short of experimental accuracy in the majority of cases in which \na close homologue has not been solved experimentally and this has \nlimited their utility for many biological applications.\nIn this study, we develop the first, to our knowledge, computational \napproach capable of predicting protein structures to near experimental \naccuracy in a majority of cases. The neural network AlphaFold that we \ndeveloped was entered into the CASP14 assessment (May\u2013July\u00a02020; \nentered under the team name \u2018 AlphaFold2\u2019 and a completely different \nmodel from our CASP13 AlphaFold system10). The CASP assessment is \ncarried out biennially using recently solved structures that have not \nbeen deposited in the PDB or publicly disclosed so that it is a blind test https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2\nReceived: 11 May 2021\nAccepted: 12 July 2021\nPublished online: 15 July 2021\nOpen access\n Check for updates\n1DeepMind, London, UK. 2School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea. 3Artificial Intelligence Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea. 4These \nauthors contributed equally: John Jumper, Richard Evans, Alexander Pritzel, Tim Green, Michael Figurnov, Olaf Ronneberger, Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, Russ Bates, Augustin \u017d\u00eddek, Anna \nPotapenko, Alex Bridgland, Clemens Meyer, Simon A.

AlphaFold structures had a median backbone \naccuracy of 0.96\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation at 95% \nresidue coverage) (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.85\u20131.16\u00a0\u00c5) whereas \nthe next best performing method had a median backbone accuracy \nof 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u20134.0\u00a0\u00c5) (measured on \nCASP domains; see Fig.\u00a0 1a for backbone accuracy and Supplementary \nFig.\u00a014 for all-atom accuracy). As a comparison point for this accuracy, \nthe width of a carbon atom is approximately 1.4\u00a0\u00c5. In addition to very \naccurate domain structures (Fig.\u00a0 1b), AlphaFold is able to produce \nhighly accurate side chains (Fig.\u00a0 1c) when the backbone is highly accu -\nrate and considerably improves over template-based methods even \nwhen strong templates are available. The all-atom accuracy of Alpha -\nFold was 1.5\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u20131.6\u00a0\u00c5) compared \nwith the 3.5\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u20134.2\u00a0\u00c5) of the best \nalternative method. Our methods are scalable to very long proteins with \naccurate domains and domain-packing (see Fig.\u00a0 1d for the prediction \nof a 2,180-residue protein with no structural homologues). Finally, the \nmodel is able to provide precise, per-residue estimates of its reliability \nthat should enable the confident use of these predictions.\nWe demonstrate in Fig.\u00a0 2a that the high accuracy that AlphaFold dem -\nonstrated in CASP14 extends to a large sample of recently released PDB structures; in this dataset, all structures were deposited in the PDB after \nour training data cut-off and are analysed as full chains (see\u00a0Methods, \nSupplementary Fig.\u00a015 and Supplementary Table\u00a06 for more details). \nFurthermore, we observe high side-chain accuracy when the back -\nbone prediction is accurate (Fig.\u00a0 2b) and we show that our confidence \nmeasure, the predicted local-distance difference test (pLDDT), reliably \npredicts the C\u03b1 local-distance difference test (lDDT-C\u03b1) accuracy of the \ncorresponding prediction (Fig.\u00a0 2c). We also find that the global super -\nposition metric template modelling score (TM-score)27 can be accu -\nrately estimated (Fig.\u00a0 2d). Overall, these analyses validate that the high \naccuracy and reliability of AlphaFold on CASP14 proteins also transfers \nto an uncurated collection of recent PDB submissions, as would be \nexpecte",

      "summary": "The idea of this project is to study the protein structure and sequence relationship using the hidden markov model and artificial neural network. In this context we have assumed two hidden markov models. In first model we have taken protein secondary structures as hidden and protein sequences as observed. In second model we have taken protein sequences as hidden and protein structures as observed. The efficiencies for both the hidden markov models have been calculated. The results show that the efficiencies of first model is greater that the second one .These efficiencies are cross validated using artificial neural network. This signifies the importance of protein secondary structures as the main hidden controlling factors due to which we observe a particular amino acid sequence. This also signifies that protein secondary structure is more conserved in comparison to amino acid sequence.",

      "summary": "The computer artificial intelligence system AlphaFold has recently predicted previously unknown three-dimensional structures of thousands of proteins. Focusing on the subset with high-confidence scores, we algorithmically analyze these predictions for cases where the protein backbone exhibits rare topological complexity, i.e. knotting. Amongst others, we discovered a $7_1$-knot, the most topologically complex knot ever found in a protein, as well several 6-crossing composite knots comprised of two methyltransferase or carbonic anhydrase domains, each containing a simple trefoil knot. These deeply embedded composite knots occur evidently by gene duplication and interconnection of knotted dimers. Finally, we report two new five-crossing knots including the first $5_1$-knot. Our list of analyzed structures forms the basis for future experimental studies to confirm these novel knotted topologies and to explore their complex folding mechanisms.",

      "summary": "The prediction of protein stability changes following single-point mutations plays a pivotal role in computational biology, particularly in areas like drug discovery, enzyme reengineering, and genetic disease analysis. Although deep-learning strategies have pushed the field forward, their use in standard workflows remains limited due to resource demands. Conversely, potential-like methods are fast, intuitive, and efficient. Yet, these typically estimate Gibbs free energy shifts without considering the free-energy variations in the unfolded protein state, an omission that may breach mass balance and diminish accuracy. This study shows that incorporating a mass-balance correction (MBC) to account for the unfolded state significantly enhances these methods. While many machine learning models partially model this balance, our analysis suggests that a refined representation of the unfolded state may improve the predictive performance.",

      "summary": "The following briefly discusses possible difficulties in communication with and control of an AGI (artificial general intelligence), building upon an explanation of The Fermi Paradox and preceding work on symbol emergence and artificial general intelligence. The latter suggests that to infer what someone means, an agent constructs a rationale for the observed behaviour of others. Communication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and have similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any non-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for their behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of what a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed a signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may possess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their signals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi Paradox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more compressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their behaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason. Communication with and control of an AGI may subsequently necessitate not only human-like compulsions and experiences, but imposed cognitive impairment.",

Despite many advancements in planning and learning, resolving novel problems or adapting existing knowledge to a new context, especially in cases where the environment may change in unpredictable ways post deployment, remains a limiting factor in the safe and useful integration of intelligent systems. The emergence of increasingly autonomous systems dictates the necessity for AI agents to deal with environmental uncertainty through creativity. To stimulate further research in CPS, we present a definition and a framework of CPS, which we adopt to categorize existing AI methods in this field. Our framework consists of four main components of a CPS problem, namely, 1) problem formulation, 2) knowledge representation, 3) method of knowledge manipulation, and 4) method of evaluation.

      "summary": "Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

Recently, a few deep learning models have surpassed the traditional window based multilayer perceptron.

This architecture uses a novel multilayer shift-and-stitch (MUST) technique to generate fully dense per-position predictions on protein sequences. Our model is significantly simpler than the state-of-the-art, yet achieves better results.

      "summary": "Data science has become increasingly essential for the production of official statistics, as it enables the automated collection, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.\n  This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.",

      "title": "Learning Curves for Decision Making in Supervised Machine Learning: A Survey",
      "summary": "Learning curves are a concept from social sciences that has been adopted in the context of machine learning to assess the performance of a learning algorithm with respect to a certain resource, e.g., the number of training examples or the number of training iterations. Learning curves have important applications in several machine learning contexts, most notably in data acquisition, early stopping of model training, and model selection. For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use. We survey papers from the literature and classify them into this framework.",

      "title": "Foundations of GenIR",
      "summary": "The chapter discusses the foundational impact of modern generative AI models on information access (IA) systems. In contrast to traditional AI, the large-scale training and superior data modeling of generative AI models enable them to produce high-quality, human-like responses, which brings brand new opportunities for the development of IA paradigms. In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios. Additionally, it examines the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm and other methods for corpus modeling and understanding, demonstrating how generative AI can enhance information access systems. It also summarizes potential challenges and fruitful directions for future studies.",
