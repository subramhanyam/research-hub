      "title": "MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers",
      "summary": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.",

      "title": "Mind the Metrics: Patterns for Telemetry-Aware In-IDE AI Application Development using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)",
      "summary": "AI development environments are evolving into observability first platforms that integrate real time telemetry, prompt traces, and evaluation feedback into the developer workflow. This paper introduces telemetry aware integrated development environments (IDEs) enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a system that connects IDEs with prompt metrics, trace logs, and versioned control for real time refinement. We present design patterns for local prompt iteration, CI based optimization, and autonomous agents that adapt behavior using telemetry. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we describe an architecture that supports integration with frameworks like DSPy, PromptWizard, and Prompts as Programs. We demonstrate this through Opik, an open source MCP server for LLM telemetry, and position our approach within the emerging LLMOps ecosystem. This work lays a foundation for future research on prompt optimization, IDE agent tooling, and empirical benchmarking in telemetry rich AI development workflows.",

      "title": "Adaptation of TURN protocol to SIP protocol",
      "summary": "Today, SIP is a protocol par Excellence in the field of communication over Internet. But, the fact that it belongs to the application layer constitutes a weakness vis-a-vis the NAT traversal. This weakness is due to the way in which the server replies to the requests of clients on the one hand. On the other, it is caused by the dynamic allocation of UDP ports for emission and reception of packets RTP/RTCP. The TURN Protocol may face this weakness. However, its use requires a certain number of exchanges between the clients and a TURN server before establishing the multimedia sessions and this increase the latent time. In this article, we propose to adapt TURN protocol for applications based on SIP protocol such as telephony over Internet, conference video, etc. This adaptation optimises the establishment of multimedia sessions by integrating a manager of TCP connections and multimedia flow controller into SIP Proxy server.",

      "title": "Core QUIC: Enabling Dynamic, Implementation-Agnostic Protocol Extensions",
      "summary": "While applications quickly evolve, Internet protocols do not follow the same pace. There are two root causes for this. First, extending protocol with cleartext control plane is usually hindered by various network devices such as middleboxes. Second, such extensions usually require support from all participating entities, but often these run different implementations, leading to the chicken-and-egg deployment issue. The recently standardized QUIC protocol paved the way for dealing with the first concern by embedding encryption by design. However, it attracted so much interest that there is now a large heterogeneity in QUIC implementations, hence amplifying the second problem.\n  To get rid of these deployment issues and to enable inter-operable, implementation-independent innovation at transport layer, we propose a paradigm shift called Core QUIC. While Core QUIC keeps compliant with the standardized QUIC protocol, it enforces implementation architecture such that any Core QUIC-supporting participant can be extended with the same, generic bytecode. To achieve this, Core QUIC defines a standardized representation format of common QUIC structures on which plugins running in a controlled environment can operate to extend the underlying host implementation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by making two implementations Core QUIC-compliant. Then, we show that we can extend both with the same plugin code over several use cases.",

      "summary": "The Payment Protocol standard BIP70, specifying how payments in Bitcoin are performed by merchants and customers, is supported by the largest payment processors and most widely-used wallets. The protocol has been shown to be vulnerable to refund attacks due to lack of authentication of the refund addresses. In this paper, we give the first formal model of the protocol and formalise the refund address security goals for the protocol, namely refund address authentication and secrecy. The formal model utilises communication channels as abstractions conveying security goals on which the protocol modeller and verifier can rely. We analyse the Payment Protocol confirming that it is vulnerable to an attack violating the refund address authentication security goal. Moreover, we present a concrete protocol revision proposal supporting the merchant with publicly verifiable evidence that can mitigate the attack. We verify that the revised protocol meets the security goals defined for the refund address. Hence, we demonstrate that the revised protocol is secure, not only against the existing attacks, but also against any further attacks violating the formalised security goals.",

      "summary": "Anonymous Veto (AV) and Dining cryptographers (DC) are two basic primitives for the cryptographic problems where the main aim is to hide the identity of the senders of the messages. These can be achieved by classical methods where the security is based either on computational hardness or on shared private keys. In this regard, we present a secure quantum protocol for both DC and AV by exploiting the GHZ correlations. We first solve a generalized version of the DC problem with the help of multiparty GHZ state. This allow us to provide a secure quantum protocol for the AV. Securities for both the protocols rely on some novel and fundamental features of GHZ correlations related to quantum nonlocality.",

      "summary": "For network computers to communicate to one another, they need to know one another's IP address and MAC address. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is developed to find the Ethernet address that map to a specific IP address. The source computer broadcasts the request for Ethernet address and eventually the target computer replies. The IP to Ethernet address mapping would later be stored in an ARP Cache for some time duration, after which the process is repeated. Since ARP is susceptible to ARP poisoning attacks, we propose to make it unicast, centralized and secure, along with a secure design of DHCP protocol to mitigate MAC spoofing. The secure protocol designs are explained in detail. Lastly we also discuss some performance issues to show how the proposed protocols work.",

      "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNN) represent an emerging line of deep learning models that operate on graph structures. It is becoming more and more popular due to its high accuracy achieved in many graph-related tasks. However, GNN is not as well understood in the system and architecture community as its counterparts such as multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. This work tries to introduce the GNN to our community. In contrast to prior work that only presents characterizations of GCNs, our work covers a large portion of the varieties for GNN workloads based on a general GNN description framework. By constructing the models on top of two widely-used libraries, we characterize the GNN computation at inference stage concerning general-purpose and application-specific architectures and hope our work can foster more system and architecture research for GNNs.",

      "summary": "Applications with low data reuse and frequent irregular memory accesses, such as graph or sparse linear algebra workloads, fail to scale well due to memory bottlenecks and poor core utilization. While prior work with prefetching, decoupling, or pipelining can mitigate memory latency and improve core utilization, memory bottlenecks persist due to limited off-chip bandwidth. Approaches doing processing in-memory (PIM) with Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) overcome bandwidth limitations but fail to achieve high core utilization due to poor task scheduling and synchronization overheads. Moreover, the high memory-per-core ratio available with HMC limits strong scaling.\n  We introduce Dalorex, a hardware-software co-design that achieves high parallelism and energy efficiency, demonstrating strong scaling with >16,000 cores when processing graph and sparse linear algebra workloads. Over the prior work in PIM, both using 256 cores, Dalorex improves performance and energy consumption by two orders of magnitude through (1) a tile-based distributed-memory architecture where each processing tile holds an equal amount of data, and all memory operations are local; (2) a task-based parallel programming model where tasks are executed by the processing unit that is co-located with the target data; (3) a network design optimized for irregular traffic, where all communication is one-way, and messages do not contain routing metadata; (4) novel traffic-aware task scheduling hardware that maintains high core utilization; and (5) a data placement strategy that improves work balance.\n  This work proposes architectural and software innovations to provide the greatest scalability to date for running graph algorithms while still being programmable for other domains.",

Under this regularity condition, the normalization argument in asymptotic analysis enables us to see the solution existence as well as the solution stability of these problems.

Moreover, we show results on the stability such as upper semicontinuity and local upper-H\u00f6lder stability of the solution map of polynomial optimization problems.

      "summary": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) often lack interfaces for remote debugging. Thus, fault diagnosis and troubleshooting are conducted at the deployment site. Currently, WSN operators lack dedicated tools that aid them in this process. Therefore, we introduce EyeSec, a tool for WSN monitoring and maintenance in the field. An Augmented Reality Device (AR Device) identifies sensor nodes using optical markers. Portable Sniffer Units capture network traffic and extract information. With those data, the AR Device network topology and data flows between sensor nodes are visualized. Unlike previous tools, EyeSec is fully portable, independent of any given infrastructure and does not require dedicated and expensive AR hardware. Using passive inspection only, it can be retrofitted to already deployed WSNs. We implemented a proof of concept on low-cost embedded hardware and commodity smart phones and demonstrate the usage of EyeSec within a WSN test bed using the 6LoWPAN transmission protocol.",

      "title": "A Comparison of Link Layer Attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks",
      "summary": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and unique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor nodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost, invisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and limited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer attacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable on WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel, untrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and limited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks; but we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's constraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs, divide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them, include: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a wide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work enables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the goal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this paper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms against the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to manage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively.",
