      "summary": "The idea of this project is to study the protein structure and sequence relationship using the hidden markov model and artificial neural network. In this context we have assumed two hidden markov models. In first model we have taken protein secondary structures as hidden and protein sequences as observed. In second model we have taken protein sequences as hidden and protein structures as observed. The efficiencies for both the hidden markov models have been calculated. The results show that the efficiencies of first model is greater that the second one .These efficiencies are cross validated using artificial neural network. This signifies the importance of protein secondary structures as the main hidden controlling factors due to which we observe a particular amino acid sequence. This also signifies that protein secondary structure is more conserved in comparison to amino acid sequence.",

      "summary": "The computer artificial intelligence system AlphaFold has recently predicted previously unknown three-dimensional structures of thousands of proteins. Focusing on the subset with high-confidence scores, we algorithmically analyze these predictions for cases where the protein backbone exhibits rare topological complexity, i.e. knotting. Amongst others, we discovered a $7_1$-knot, the most topologically complex knot ever found in a protein, as well several 6-crossing composite knots comprised of two methyltransferase or carbonic anhydrase domains, each containing a simple trefoil knot. These deeply embedded composite knots occur evidently by gene duplication and interconnection of knotted dimers. Finally, we report two new five-crossing knots including the first $5_1$-knot. Our list of analyzed structures forms the basis for future experimental studies to confirm these novel knotted topologies and to explore their complex folding mechanisms.",

      "summary": "The prediction of protein stability changes following single-point mutations plays a pivotal role in computational biology, particularly in areas like drug discovery, enzyme reengineering, and genetic disease analysis. Although deep-learning strategies have pushed the field forward, their use in standard workflows remains limited due to resource demands. Conversely, potential-like methods are fast, intuitive, and efficient. Yet, these typically estimate Gibbs free energy shifts without considering the free-energy variations in the unfolded protein state, an omission that may breach mass balance and diminish accuracy. This study shows that incorporating a mass-balance correction (MBC) to account for the unfolded state significantly enhances these methods. While many machine learning models partially model this balance, our analysis suggests that a refined representation of the unfolded state may improve the predictive performance.",

Some of these approaches suffer from the insensitivity to the geometrical properties of the proteins (lattice models), while others are computationally heavy (traditional MD).\n  Results: We use a recently-proposed approach of Zhou and Karplus to study the folding of the protein model based on the discrete time molecular dynamics algorithm. We show that this algorithm resolves with respect to time the folding --- unfolding transition. In addition, we demonstrate the ability to study the coreof the model protein.\n  Conclusion: The algorithm along with the model of inter-residue interactions can serve as a tool to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein models.",

      "summary": "Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

      "summary": "The following briefly discusses possible difficulties in communication with and control of an AGI (artificial general intelligence), building upon an explanation of The Fermi Paradox and preceding work on symbol emergence and artificial general intelligence. The latter suggests that to infer what someone means, an agent constructs a rationale for the observed behaviour of others. Communication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and have similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any non-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for their behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of what a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed a signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may possess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their signals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi Paradox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more compressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their behaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason. Communication with and control of an AGI may subsequently necessitate not only human-like compulsions and experiences, but imposed cognitive impairment.",

Despite many advancements in planning and learning, resolving novel problems or adapting existing knowledge to a new context, especially in cases where the environment may change in unpredictable ways post deployment, remains a limiting factor in the safe and useful integration of intelligent systems. The emergence of increasingly autonomous systems dictates the necessity for AI agents to deal with environmental uncertainty through creativity. To stimulate further research in CPS, we present a definition and a framework of CPS, which we adopt to categorize existing AI methods in this field. Our framework consists of four main components of a CPS problem, namely, 1) problem formulation, 2) knowledge representation, 3) method of knowledge manipulation, and 4) method of evaluation. We conclude our survey with open research questions, and suggested directions for the future.",

      "summary": "Predicting protein properties such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure from its primary amino acid sequence is an important task in bioinformatics. Recently, a few deep learning models have surpassed the traditional window based multilayer perceptron. Taking inspiration from the image classification domain we propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture, MUST-CNN, to predict protein properties. This architecture uses a novel multilayer shift-and-stitch (MUST) technique to generate fully dense per-position predictions on protein sequences. Our model is significantly simpler than the state-of-the-art, yet achieves better results. By combining MUST and the efficient convolution operation, we can consider far more parameters while retaining very fast prediction speeds. We beat the state-of-the-art performance on two large protein property prediction datasets.",

Most computational prediction techniques require protein structures which limit their applicability to protein complexes with known structures.

Our paper highlights the fact that the generalization performance of even the state of the art sequence-only predictor of binding affinity is far from satisfactory and that the development of effective and practical methods in this domain is still an open problem. We also propose a novel sequence-only predictor of binding affinity called ISLAND which gives better accuracy than existing methods over the same validation set as well as on external independent test dataset.

      "summary": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are associated with various diseases, including cancer, infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. Obtaining three-dimensional structural information on these PPIs serves as a foundation to interfere with those or to guide drug design. Various strategies can be followed to model those complexes, all typically resulting in a large number of models. A challenging step in this process is the identification of good models (near-native PPI conformations) from the large pool of generated models. To address this challenge, we previously developed DeepRank-GNN-esm, a graph-based deep learning algorithm for ranking modelled PPI structures harnessing the power of protein language models.

      "title": "Protein Folding: A Perspective From Statistical Physics",
      "summary": "In this paper, we introduce an approach to the protein folding problem from the point of view of statistical physics. Protein folding is a stochastic process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional 3D structure from random coil. The process involves an intricate interplay between global geometry and local structure, and each protein seems to present special problems. We introduce CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk), a model of protein folding that combines the features of self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the Monte Carlo method. In this model, the unfolded protein chain is treated as a random coil described by SAW. Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and other interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account by imposing conditions on SAW. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a generalized Langevin equation. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities of the model, we consider several examples, including helix formation, elastic properties, and the transition in the folding of myoglobin. From the CSAW simulation and physical arguments, we find a universal elastic energy for proteins, which depends only on the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ and the residue number $N$. The elastic energy gives rise to scaling laws $R_{g}\\sim N^\u03bd$ in different regions with exponents $\u03bd=3/5,3/7,2/5$, consistent with the observed unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively. These results indicate that CSAW can serve as a theoretical laboratory to study universal principles in protein folding.",
