      "title": "MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers",
      "summary": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.",

      "summary": "AI development environments are evolving into observability first platforms that integrate real time telemetry, prompt traces, and evaluation feedback into the developer workflow. This paper introduces telemetry aware integrated development environments (IDEs) enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a system that connects IDEs with prompt metrics, trace logs, and versioned control for real time refinement. We present design patterns for local prompt iteration, CI based optimization, and autonomous agents that adapt behavior using telemetry. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we describe an architecture that supports integration with frameworks like DSPy, PromptWizard, and Prompts as Programs. We demonstrate this through Opik, an open source MCP server for LLM telemetry, and position our approach within the emerging LLMOps ecosystem. This work lays a foundation for future research on prompt optimization, IDE agent tooling, and empirical benchmarking in telemetry rich AI development workflows.",

      "title": "Adaptation of TURN protocol to SIP protocol",
      "summary": "Today, SIP is a protocol par Excellence in the field of communication over Internet. But, the fact that it belongs to the application layer constitutes a weakness vis-a-vis the NAT traversal. This weakness is due to the way in which the server replies to the requests of clients on the one hand. On the other, it is caused by the dynamic allocation of UDP ports for emission and reception of packets RTP/RTCP. The TURN Protocol may face this weakness. However, its use requires a certain number of exchanges between the clients and a TURN server before establishing the multimedia sessions and this increase the latent time. In this article, we propose to adapt TURN protocol for applications based on SIP protocol such as telephony over Internet, conference video, etc. This adaptation optimises the establishment of multimedia sessions by integrating a manager of TCP connections and multimedia flow controller into SIP Proxy server.",

      "title": "Node Disjoint Multipath Routing Considering Link and Node Stability protocol: A characteristic Evaluation",
      "summary": "Mobile Ad hoc Networks are highly dynamic networks. Quality of Service (QoS) routing in such networks is usually limited by the network breakage due to either node mobility or energy depletion of the mobile nodes. Also, to fulfill certain quality parameters, presence of multiple node-disjoint paths becomes essential. Such paths aid in the optimal traffic distribution and reliability in case of path breakages. Thus, to cater various challenges in QoS routing in Mobile Add hoc Networks, a Node Disjoint Multipath Routing Considering Link and Node Stability (NDMLNR) protocol has been proposed by the authors. The metric used to select the paths takes into account the stability of the nodes and the corresponding links. This paper studies various challenges in the QoS routing and presents the characteristic evaluation of NDMLNR w.r.t various existing protocols in this area.",

      "summary": "Most of multipath multimedia streaming proposals use Forward Error Correction (FEC) approach to protect from packet losses. However, FEC does not sustain well burst of losses even when packets from a given FEC block are spread over multiple paths. In this article, we propose an online multipath convolutional coding for real-time multipath streaming based on an on-the-fly coding scheme called Tetrys. We evaluate the benefits brought out by this coding scheme inside an existing FEC multipath load splitting proposal known as Encoded Multipath Streaming (EMS). We demonstrate that Tetrys consistently outperforms FEC in both uniform and burst losses with EMS scheme. We also propose a modification of the standard EMS algorithm that greatly improves the performance in terms of packet recovery. Finally, we analyze different spreading policies of the Tetrys redundancy traffic between available paths and observe that the longer propagation delay path should be preferably used to carry repair packets.",

      "summary": "Assessing centrality in network systems is critical for understanding node importance and guiding decision-making processes. In dynamic networks, incorporating a controllability perspective is essential for identifying key nodes. In this paper, we study two control theoretic centrality measures -- the Volumetric Controllability Score (VCS) and Average Energy Controllability Score (AECS) -- to quantify node importance in linear time-invariant network systems. We prove the uniqueness of VCS and AECS for almost all specified terminal times, thereby enhancing their applicability beyond previously recognized cases. This ensures their interpretability, comparability, and reproducibility. Our analysis reveals substantial differences between VCS and AECS in linear systems with symmetric and skew-symmetric transition matrices. We also investigate the dependence of VCS and AECS on the terminal time and prove that when this parameter is extremely small, both scores become essentially uniform. Additionally, we prove that a sequence generated by a projected gradient method for computing VCS and AECS converges linearly to both measures under several assumptions. Finally, evaluations on brain networks modeled via Laplacian dynamics using real data reveal contrasting evaluation tendencies and correlations for VCS and AECS, with AECS favoring brain regions associated with cognitive and motor functions, while VCS emphasizes sensory and emotional regions.",

      "summary": "We deal with controlling the spread of an epidemic disease on a network by isolating one or multiple locations by banning people from leaving them. To this aim, we build on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and the susceptible-infected-removed discrete-time network models, encapsulating a control action that captures mobility bans via removing links from the network. Then, we formulate the problem of optimally devising a control policy based on mobility bans that trades-off the burden on the healthcare system and the social and economic costs associated with interventions. The binary nature of mobility bans hampers the possibility to solve the control problem with standard optimization methods, yielding a NP-hard problem. Here, this is tackled by deriving a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the control problem, and leveraging the growing potentialities of quantum computing to efficiently solve it.",

      "summary": "The use of real-time applications over the Internet is a challenging problem that the QoS epoch attempted to solve by proposing the DiffServ architecture. Today, the only existing service provided by the Internet is still best-effort. As a result, multimedia applications often perform on top of a transport layer that provides a variable sending rate. In an obvious manner, this variable sending rate is an issue for these applications with strong delay constraint. In a real-time context where retransmission can not be used to ensure reliability, video quality suffers from any packet losses. In this position paper, we discuss this problem and motivate why we want to bring out a certain class of erasure coding scheme inside multimedia congestion control protocols such as TFRC.",

      "summary": "When `cyber' is used as a prefix, attention is typically drawn to the technological and spectacular aspects of war and conflict -- and, by extension, security. We offer a different approach to engaging with and understanding security in such contexts, by foregrounding the everyday -- mundane -- experiences of security within communities living with and fleeing from war. We do so through three vignettes from our field research in Colombia, Lebanon and Sweden, respectively, and by highlighting the significance of ethnography for security research with communities living in regions afflicted by war. We conclude by setting out a call to action for security researchers and practitioners to consider such lived experiences in the design of security technology that aims to cater to the needs of communities in `global conflict and disaster regions'.",

      "summary": "Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems represent a significant advancement in diabetes care and wearable physiological closed-loop control technologies, integrating continuous glucose monitoring, control algorithms, and insulin pumps to improve blood glucose level control and reduce the burden of patient self-management. However, their increasing dependence on wireless communication and automatic control introduces security risks that may compromise patient privacy or result in life-threatening treatment errors. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the AID system security landscape, covering technical vulnerabilities, regulatory frameworks, and commercial security measures. In addition, we conduct a systematic review of attack vectors and defence mechanisms proposed in the literature, following the PRISMA framework. Our findings highlight critical gaps, including the lack of specific security evaluation frameworks, insufficient protections in real-world deployments, and the need for comprehensive, lightweight, and adaptive defence mechanisms. We further investigate available research resources and outline open research challenges and future directions to guide the development of more secure and reliable AID systems. By focusing on AID systems, this review offers a representative case study for examining and improving the cybersecurity of safety-critical medical wearable systems.",

      "summary": "Software systems continuously evolve due to new functionalities, requirements, or maintenance activities. In the context of software evolution, software refactoring has gained a strategic relevance. The space of possible software refactoring is usually very large, as it is given by the combinations of different refactoring actions that can produce software system alternatives. Multi-objective algorithms have shown the ability to discover alternatives by pursuing different objectives simultaneously. Performance of such algorithms in the context of software model refactoring is of paramount importance. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a performance analysis of three genetic algorithms to compare them in terms of performance and quality of solutions. Our results show that there are significant differences in performance among the algorithms (e.g., PESA2 seems to be the fastest one, while NSGA-II shows the least memory usage).",

In the IEEE 802.11s network, the node selection, scalability, stability, density of the nodes, mobility of the nodes, transmission power, and routing are major issues that WMN suffers. In this paper, a critical review of MAC protocols and their Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for WMN is presented to attain a better understanding of MAC protocols. Furthermore, the critical comparative analysis and recommendation of MAC procedures for WMN using Multi-objective optimization and statistical testing framework are performed. This framework is used for the analysis and recommendation of different protocols available for QoS parameters.",
