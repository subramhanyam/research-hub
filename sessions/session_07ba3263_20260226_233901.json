  "topic": "Research Brief: Accurate Prediction of Protein 3D Structure using Artificial Intelligence   1. Background  The prediction of a protein's three-dimensional (3D) structure from its amino acid sequence is a fundamental problem in biochemistry and molecular biology. Traditional experimental methods for determining protein structures, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are time-consuming and expensive. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in predicting protein structures directly from their amino acid sequences, potentially revolutionizing the field.  2. Current State of Research  An analysis of 13 papers in the field reveals that current research focuses on developing and improving AI algorithms for protein structure prediction. These papers cover various aspects, including the use of machine learning models, deep learning techniques, and sequence-based features to predict protein structures. While significant progress has been made, the accuracy and reliability of these predictions remain a challenge, particularly for larger and more complex proteins.  3. Identified Research Gaps  Although the analysis did not identify any strong research gaps, three weak gaps were detected: 1. Limited generalizability: Current AI models may not perform well on diverse protein sequences or structures, highlighting the need for more robust and generalizable models. 2. Insufficient training data: The availability of high-quality training data for protein structure prediction is limited, which can hinder the development of accurate AI models. 3. Lack of interpretability: The complex nature of AI models can make it difficult to understand the underlying factors contributing to their predictions, which is essential for improving the accuracy and reliability of protein structure prediction.  4. Proposed Research Ideas  Unfortunately, due to the lack of specific research ideas and novelty scores in the provided data, we cannot propose concrete research ideas at this time. However, potential areas of investigation may include: * Developing more robust and generalizable AI models for protein structure prediction * Creating larger, more diverse datasets for training and testing AI models * Improving the interpretability of AI models to understand the underlying factors contributing to their predictions  5. Recommended Next Steps  To address the identified research gaps and advance the field of protein structure prediction using AI, we recommend the following next steps: 1. Develop and share large, diverse datasets for training and testing AI models to improve their generalizability and accuracy. 2. Investigate new AI architectures and techniques, such as attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, to improve the performance and interpretability of protein structure prediction models. 3. Collaborate across disciplines to combine the strengths of biochemistry, molecular biology, and AI research, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable protein structure predictions.  References  Due to the lack of specific paper citations in the provided data, we cannot list the references at this time. However, the analysis of 13 papers in the field of protein structure prediction using AI provides a foundation for further research and investigation.",

Through an enormous experimental \neffort1\u20134, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but \nthis represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural \ncoverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed \nto address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the \nthree-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid \nsequence\u2014the structure prediction component of the \u2018protein folding problem\u2019\n8\u2014has \nbeen an important open research problem for more than 50\u00a0years9. Despite recent \nprogress10\u201314, existing methods fall far\u00a0short of atomic accuracy, especially when no \nhomologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method \nthat can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which \nno similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural \nnetwork-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein \nStructure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with \nexperimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other \nmethods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning \napproach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, \nleveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.\nThe development of computational methods to predict \nthree-dimensional (3D) protein structures from the protein sequence \nhas proceeded along two complementary paths that focus on either the \nphysical interactions or the evolutionary history. The physical interac-\ntion programme heavily integrates our understanding of molecular \ndriving forces into either thermodynamic or kinetic simulation of pro -\ntein physics16 or statistical approximations thereof17. Although theoreti -\ncally very appealing, this approach has proved highly challenging for \neven moderate-sized proteins due to the computational intractability \nof molecular simulation, the context dependence of protein stability \nand the difficulty of producing sufficiently accurate models of protein \nphysics. The evolutionary programme has provided an alternative in \nrecent years, in which the constraints on protein structure are derived \nfrom bioinformatics analysis of the evolutionary history of proteins, \nhomology to solved structures18,19 and pairwise evolutionary correla-\ntions20\u201324. This bioinformatics approach has benefited greatly from the steady growth of experimental protein structures deposited in \nthe Protein Data Bank (PDB)5, the explosion of genomic sequencing \nand the rapid development of deep learning techniques to interpret \nthese correlations. Despite these advances, contemporary physical \nand evolutionary-history-based approaches produce predictions that \nare far\u00a0short of experimental accuracy in the majority of cases in which \na close homologue has not been solved experimentally and this has \nlimited their utility for many biological applications.\nIn this study, we develop the first, to our knowledge, computational \napproach capable of predicting protein structures to near experimental \naccuracy in a majority of cases. The neural network AlphaFold that we \ndeveloped was entered into the CASP14 assessment (May\u2013July\u00a02020; \nentered under the team name \u2018 AlphaFold2\u2019 and a completely different \nmodel from our CASP13 AlphaFold system10). The CASP assessment is \ncarried out biennially using recently solved structures that have not \nbeen deposited in the PDB or publicly disclosed so that it is a blind test https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2\nReceived: 11 May 2021\nAccepted: 12 July 2021\nPublished online: 15 July 2021\nOpen access\n Check for updates\n1DeepMind, London, UK. 2School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea. 3Artificial Intelligence Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea. 4These \nauthors contributed equally: John Jumper, Richard Evans, Alexander Pritzel, Tim Green, Michael Figurnov, Olaf Ronneberger, Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, Russ Bates, Augustin \u017d\u00eddek, Anna \nPotapenko, Alex Bridgland, Clemens Meyer, Simon A.

AlphaFold structures had a median backbone \naccuracy of 0.96\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation at 95% \nresidue coverage) (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.85\u20131.16\u00a0\u00c5) whereas \nthe next best performing method had a median backbone accuracy \nof 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u20134.0\u00a0\u00c5) (measured on \nCASP domains; see Fig.\u00a0 1a for backbone accuracy and Supplementary \nFig.\u00a014 for all-atom accuracy). As a comparison point for this accuracy, \nthe width of a carbon atom is approximately 1.4\u00a0\u00c5. In addition to very \naccurate domain structures (Fig.\u00a0 1b), AlphaFold is able to produce \nhighly accurate side chains (Fig.\u00a0 1c) when the backbone is highly accu -\nrate and considerably improves over template-based methods even \nwhen strong templates are available. The all-atom accuracy of Alpha -\nFold was 1.5\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u20131.6\u00a0\u00c5) compared \nwith the 3.5\u00a0\u00c5 r.m.s.d.95 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u20134.2\u00a0\u00c5) of the best \nalternative method. Our methods are scalable to very long proteins with \naccurate domains and domain-packing (see Fig.\u00a0 1d for the prediction \nof a 2,180-residue protein with no structural homologues). Finally, the \nmodel is able to provide precise, per-residue estimates of its reliability \nthat should enable the confident use of these predictions.\nWe demonstrate in Fig.\u00a0 2a that the high accuracy that AlphaFold dem -\nonstrated in CASP14 extends to a large sample of recently released PDB structures; in this dataset, all structures were deposited in the PDB after \nour training data cut-off and are analysed as full chains (see\u00a0Methods, \nSupplementary Fig.\u00a015 and Supplementary Table\u00a06 for more details). \nFurthermore, we observe high side-chain accuracy when the back -\nbone prediction is accurate (Fig.\u00a0 2b) and we show that our confidence \nmeasure, the predicted local-distance difference test (pLDDT), reliably \npredicts the C\u03b1 local-distance difference test (lDDT-C\u03b1) accuracy of the \ncorresponding prediction (Fig.\u00a0 2c). We also find that the global super -\nposition metric template modelling score (TM-score)27 can be accu -\nrately estimated (Fig.\u00a0 2d). Overall, these analyses validate that the high \naccuracy and reliability of AlphaFold on CASP14 proteins also transfers \nto an uncurated collection of recent PDB submissions, as would be \nexpecte",
