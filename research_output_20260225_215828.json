      "title": "Agricultural Policy in Ukraine",
      "summary": "Building upon the theory and methodology of agricultural policy developed in the previous chapter, in Chapter 2 we analyse and assess agricultural policy making in Ukraine since the breakup of Soviet Union till today. Going from top down to the bottom, we begin by describing the evolution of state policy in the agri-food sector. In the beginning, we describe the major milestones of agricultural policy making since independence, paving the way to the political economy of the modern agricultural policy in Ukraine. Then we describe the role of agri-food sector in the national economy as well as globally in ensuring food security in the world. After, we dig deeper and focus on a detailed performance of agricultural sector by looking at farm structures, their land use, overall and sector-wise untapped productivity potential. Modern agricultural policy and institutional set-up is contained and analyzed in details in the section 2.4. A review of the agricultural up- and downstream sectors wraps up this chapter",

      "summary": "To support building permit issuing with automatic digital tools, the reuse of models produced by designers would make the process quicker and more objective. However, current studies and pilots often leave a gap with respect to the models as actually provided by architects, having varying quality and content. In this study, rather than taking a top down approach, we started from the available data and made the necessary inferences, which gave the opportunity to tackle basic and common issues often preventing smooth automatic processing. Specific characteristics of the IFC models were outlined and a tool was developed to extract the necessary information from them to check representative regulations. While the case study is specific in location, regulations and input models, the type of issues encountered are a generally applicable example for automated code compliance checking. This represents a solid base for future works towards the automation of building permits issuing.",

      "summary": "Data science has become increasingly essential for the production of official statistics, as it enables the automated collection, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.\n  This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.",

The recent shocks to the free trade regime, especially trade disputes among major economies, as well as black swan events, such as trade wars and pandemics, raise the need for improved predictions to inform policy decisions. AI methods are allowing economists to solve such prediction problems in new ways. In this manuscript, we present novel methods that predict and associate food and agricultural commodities traded internationally. Association Rules (AR) analysis has been deployed successfully for economic scenarios at the consumer or store level, such as for market basket analysis. In our work however, we present analysis of imports and exports associations and their effects on commodity trade flows. Moreover, Ensemble Machine Learning methods are developed to provide improved agricultural trade predictions, outlier events' implications, and quantitative pointers to policy makers.",

      "title": "Spatial Monitoring and Insect Behavioural Analysis Using Computer Vision for Precision Pollination",
      "summary": "Insects are the most important global pollinator of crops and play a key role in maintaining the sustainability of natural ecosystems. Insect pollination monitoring and management are therefore essential for improving crop production and food security. Computer vision facilitated pollinator monitoring can intensify data collection over what is feasible using manual approaches. The new data it generates may provide a detailed understanding of insect distributions and facilitate fine-grained analysis sufficient to predict their pollination efficacy and underpin precision pollination. Current computer vision facilitated insect tracking in complex outdoor environments is restricted in spatial coverage and often constrained to a single insect species. This limits its relevance to agriculture. Therefore, in this article we introduce a novel system to facilitate markerless data capture for insect counting, insect motion tracking, behaviour analysis and pollination prediction across large agricultural areas. Our system is comprised of edge computing multi-point video recording, offline automated multispecies insect counting, tracking and behavioural analysis. We implement and test our system on a commercial berry farm to demonstrate its capabilities. Our system successfully tracked four insect varieties, at nine monitoring stations within polytunnels, obtaining an F-score above 0.8 for each variety. The system enabled calculation of key metrics to assess the relative pollination impact of each insect variety. With this technological advancement, detailed, ongoing data collection for precision pollination becomes achievable. This is important to inform growers and apiarists managing crop pollination, as it allows data-driven decisions to be made to improve food production and food security.",

The proposed approach takes the source image in the spatial domain, automatically selects the best frequencies from the frequency domain, and transmits the inverse-transform image to the main neural network. Remarkably, such a simple add-on layer dramatically improves the performance of the main network regardless of its design. We observe that the light networks gain a noticeable boost in the performance metrics; whereas, the training of the heavy ones converges faster when our adaptive layer is allowed to \"learn\" alongside the main architecture. We validate the idea in four classical computer vision tasks: classification, segmentation, denoising, and erasing, considering popular natural and medical data benchmarks.",

In contrast to traditional AI, the large-scale training and superior data modeling of generative AI models enable them to produce high-quality, human-like responses, which brings brand new opportunities for the development of IA paradigms. In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios. Additionally, it examines the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm and other methods for corpus modeling and understanding, demonstrating how generative AI can enhance information access systems. It also summarizes potential challenges and fruitful directions for future studies.",

Research addressed: How has OpenAI's public discourse leveraged 'ethics', 'safety', 'alignment' and adjacent related concepts over time, and what does discourse signal about framing in practice? A structured corpus, differentiating between communication for a general audience and communication with an academic audience, was assembled from public documentation. Analysis. Qualitative content analysis of ethical themes combined inductively derived and deductively applied codes. Quantitative analysis leveraged computational content analysis methods via NLP to model topics and quantify changes in rhetoric over time. Visualizations report aggregate results. For reproducible results, we have released our code at https://github.com/famous-blue-raincoat/AI_Ethics_Discourse. Results. Results indicate that safety and risk discourse dominate OpenAI's public communication and documentation, without applying academic and advocacy ethics frameworks or vocabularies. Conclusions.

      "summary": "This study investigated the use of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry and soil image analysis for rapid soil fertility assessment, with a focus on key indicators such as available boron (B), organic carbon (OC), available manganese (Mn), available sulfur (S), and the sulfur availability index (SAI). A total of 1,133 soil samples from diverse agro-climatic zones in Eastern India were analyzed. The research integrated color and texture features from microscopic soil images, PXRF data, and auxiliary soil variables (AVs) using a Random Forest model. Results showed that combining image features (IFs) with AVs significantly improved prediction accuracy for available B (R2 = 0.80) and OC (R2 = 0.88). A data fusion approach, incorporating IFs, AVs, and PXRF data, further enhanced predictions for available Mn and SAI, with R2 values of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. The study highlights the potential of integrating these technologies to offer rapid, cost-effective soil testing methods, paving the way for more advanced predictive models and a deeper understanding of soil fertility. Future work should explore the application of deep learning models on a larger dataset, incorporating soils from a wider range of agro-climatic zones under field conditions.",

      "summary": "Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

      "summary": "Nowadays, precision agriculture combined with modern information and communications technologies, is becoming more common in agricultural activities such as automated irrigation systems, precision planting, variable rate applications of nutrients and pesticides, and agricultural decision support systems. In the latter, crop management data analysis, based on machine learning and data mining, focuses mainly on how to efficiently forecast and improve crop yield. In recent years, raw and semi-processed agricultural data are usually collected using sensors, robots, satellites, weather stations, farm equipment, farmers and agribusinesses while the Internet of Things (IoT) should deliver the promise of wirelessly connecting objects and devices in the agricultural ecosystem. Agricultural data typically captures information about farming entities and operations. Every farming entity encapsulates an individual farming concept, such as field, crop, seed, soil, temperature, humidity, pest, and weed. Agricultural datasets are spatial, temporal, complex, heterogeneous, non-standardized, and very large. In particular, agricultural data is considered as Big Data in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Designing and developing a data warehouse for precision agriculture is a key foundation for establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. Some of the requirements for such an agricultural data warehouse are privacy, security, and real-time access among its stakeholders (e.g., farmers, farm equipment manufacturers, agribusinesses, co-operative societies, customers and possibly Government agencies). However, currently there are very few reports in the literature that focus on the design of efficient data warehouses with the view of enabling Agricultural Big Data analysis and data mining.

This study evaluates the robustness of the Actuaries Climate Index$^{TM}$ (ACI), a newer entrant in the field as a tool for measuring climate impacts, by comparing its explanatory power with well-established weather-based indexes (WBIs) across two key sectors. In the agricultural context, the yields of three major crops are predicted using generalized statistical models and advanced machine learning algorithms with climate indexes as explanatory variables. To enhance model reliability and address multicollinearity among weather-related variables, the study also incorporates both principal component analysis and functional principal component analysis. A total of 22 models, each constructed with different sets of explanatory variables, demonstrate the significant impact of wind speed and sea-level changes, alongside temperature and precipitation, on crop yield variability across six regions of the United States. For the financial market application, the analysis adapts the weather derivative framework, as it is a critical instrument for energy companies, insurers, and agribusinesses seeking to hedge against weather-related risks. By analyzing the payoffs of derivative contracts that use WBIs and ACI components as underlying variables, the findings reveal that the ACI framework holds a strong potential as a comprehensive climate risk indicator, not only for the agricultural sector but also for the finance and insurance industries.",
